## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Hardware Assembly

1. **ESP32 + SONGLE relay modules** (2× SRD-5VDC-SL-C relays)
2. **Connect outputs**:
   - GPIO 16 → Relay IN1 (Valve control) → 24V electrovalves (NC+NO in parallel)
   - GPIO 19 → Relay IN2 (Pump control) → 220V pump motor
3. **Connect temperature sensor**:
   - DS18B20 data line → GPIO 33 (with 4.7kΩ pull-up to 3.3V)
4. **Pull-down resistors**: 10kΩ from GPIO 16 to GND, 10kΩ from GPIO 19 to GND
5. **Wire SPDT manual switches** in parallel with ESP32 relay outputs (optional)
6. **Power supply**: 220V AC → 24V DC (5.5A) → LM2596S → 5V for ESP32/relays

### 2. Firmware Configuration

1. **Copy secrets template**:
   ```bash
   cd firmware/include
   cp "secrets (example).h" secrets.h
   ```

2. **Edit `secrets.h`** with your credentials:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "YourWiFi"
   #define WIFI_PASS "YourPassword"
   #define MQTT_USER "dashboard-user"
   #define MQTT_PASS "your-mqtt-password"
   ```

3. **Adjust `config.h`** if needed:
   - Change GPIO pins if using different connections
   - Verify MQTT topics match your dashboard configuration

### 3. Flash Firmware

```bash
cd firmware
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor  # View serial output
```

**Expected boot sequence**:

### Manual Override

**Manual SPDT switches work in parallel with ESP32:**

1. **Scenario**: Dashboard shows pump OFF, but you flip manual switch → Pump turns ON
2. **ESP32 has no feedback** - it doesn't know about manual changes
3. **Both controls work independently** - OR logic (either manual OR ESP32 can activate)

**Note**: ESP32 operates "blind" - it sends commands but doesn't verify state. If manual switch is used, dashboard won't reflect the change.

---

## 🔧 Control Logic

### Pump Control (Standard Relay)

```cpp
// User clicks "Turn ON" in dashboard
1. Set GPIO 19 HIGH (relay closes)
2. Pump motor receives 220V AC power
3. Update internal state variable
4. Publish "ON" to MQTT pump/state topic
```

### Valve Control (Single Relay, NC+NO Parallel)

```cpp
// User clicks "Change to Mode 2"
1. Set GPIO 16 HIGH (relay energizes)
2. NC valve closes, NO valve opens (opposite polarity)
3. Water flow direction changes
4. Update internal mode variable
5. Publish "2" to MQTT valve/state topic
```

### Temperature Reading

**DS18B20 OneWire sensor on GPIO 33:**

```cpp
// Every 60 seconds in loop()
1. Request temperature from sensor
2. Wait for conversion (~750ms max)
3. Read temperature value (°C with 1 decimal)
4. Publish to MQTT temperature/state topic
```

---

## ⏰ Automatic Program Execution

The dashboard checks every 15 minutes if any enabled program should be running:

1. **Time Matching**: Compares current time against program schedules
2. **Day Matching**: JavaScript `Date.getDay()` matches schedule (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.)
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Slot priority system (slot 0 beats slot 1 beats slot 2)
4. **MQTT Commands**: Publishes pump ON and valve mode commands
5. **Manual Override**: Detects user intervention and pauses until next day
6. **Midnight Reset**: Automatic resume at 00:00 after manual override

### Timer Synchronization

Timer state is synchronized between ESP32 and dashboard:
- ESP32 sends timer state updates every 10 seconds
- Dashboard displays countdown locally (1-second updates)
- Resync on reconnection prevents drift
- Stop command from either side stops both

### WiFi Fallback

ESP32 attempts connection to 3 networks in priority order:
1. Primary WiFi (WIFI_SSID)
2. Secondary WiFi (WIFI_SSID_2)
3. Tertiary WiFi (WIFI_SSID_3)

If all fail, periodic retry every 30 seconds.

### Custom Sensor Calibration

### Code Organization

All code files follow consistent structure with section separators:

**ESP32 Firmware** (`main.cpp`):
- Constants → State → Temperature Sensor → MQTT Publishing → Relay Control → Control Logic → Timer → MQTT Handler → WiFi → NTP → MQTT TLS → Setup/Loop

**JavaScript Modules** (`app.js`, `programas.js`):
- Constants → State → DOM Cache → Initialization → Event Listeners → Business Logic → Public API

**HTML** (`index.html`):
- Meta → Styles → Config → Header → Main Screen → Timer Screen → Programas Screen → Create Program Screen → Footer → Scripts

### ESP32 Won't Connect to WiFi

**Check:**
- SSID/password correct in `secrets.h`?
- WiFi signal strength (RSSI should be > -70 dBm)
- Try all 3 configured networks in order

### Temperature Sensor Not Reading

**Check DS18B20:**
- 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor between data line and 3.3V
- Verify VCC (3.3V or 5V) and GND connections
- Check GPIO 33 wiring
- Serial Monitor should show: `[SENSOR] Dispositivos DS18B20 encontrados: 1`

### Relay Doesn't Click

**SONGLE SRD-5VDC-SL-C relay module:**
- Verify 5V and GND connected to relay module
- Check GPIO signal wires (19 for pump, 16 for valve)
- Test with LED on GPIO pin to verify output
- Relay should audibly click when GPIO goes HIGH
- Verify 10kΩ pull-down resistors installed on GPIO 16 and 19

### ✅ Completed
- ✅ **Automatic program execution** - 15-minute interval checking with conflict resolution
- ✅ **Timer functionality** - Countdown with auto-shutoff and ESP32 sync
- ✅ **Manual override detection** - Pauses programs when user takes manual control
- ✅ **Code refactoring** - Comprehensive documentation and section separators
- ✅ **WiFi multi-network** - Automatic fallback to 3 configured networks
- ✅ **Custom waterfall icon** - SVG icon for Cascada mode
- ✅ **Responsive UI polish** - Smaller table sizes, improved spacing
- ✅ **Program scheduling** - Up to 3 weekly programs with per-day configuration
- ✅ **Conflict handling** - Timer cancellation, program priority, manual override
- ✅ **Signal strength monitoring** - Color-coded WiFi indicators
