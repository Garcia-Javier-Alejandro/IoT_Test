/**

 * @brief BLE Provisioning for WiFi credentials via Web Bluetooth API
 * 
 * This module handles WiFi credential provisioning via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
 * The ESP32 advertises a BLE service that can be discovered by the web dashboard.
 * Users can send WiFi credentials from the dashboard without switching networks.
 * 
 * Flow:
 * 1. ESP32 boots and starts BLE advertising (if no WiFi credentials)
 * 2. Dashboard uses Web Bluetooth API to scan and connect
 * 3. Dashboard writes WiFi SSID and password to BLE characteristics
 * 4. ESP32 saves credentials to NVS and attempts WiFi connection
 * 5. BLE is disabled after successful WiFi connection (saves power)
